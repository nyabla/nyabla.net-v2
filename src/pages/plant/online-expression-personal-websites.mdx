import Footnote from '../../components/Footnote.astro'

*This is the beginnings of a post, it is nowhere near coherence or completion*

Everyone is used to maintaining an online identity at this point, although
on the modern Web 2.0<Footnote>I am a serial complainer about Web 2.0, I
have a lot of gripes and issues with it. I'm nostalgic for a time I don't
even remember! Oh, Web 1.0...</Footnote> this is mostly done on social media
platforms with really limited customization and expression beyond a profile
picture and text-based posts.

With the barrier of entry being so low nowadays, I think that everyone could
benefit from having their own little space. There are no contraints or rules,
only what *you* want to do. I feel like having your own piece of the internet
is something magical.
