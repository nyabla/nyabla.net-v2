import Footnote from '../../components/Footnote.astro'

Everyone is used to maintaining an online identity at this point, although
on the modern Web 2.0<Footnote>I am a serial complainer about Web 2.0, I
have a lot of gripes and issues with it. I'm nostalgic for a time I don't
even remember! Oh, Web 1.0...</Footnote> this is mostly done on social media
platforms with really limited customization and expression beyond a profile
picture and text-based posts.

It makes me so happy to see people nurturing their own spaces on the internet,
it really allows for a kind of expression not possible in other mediums, including
other places on the internet. The notion of being able to customise every last
bit of your website, control how it looks and what it says without restriction
beyond what you can think of.

I enjoyed seeing people on sites such as twitter and tumblr maintain personal
*carrd* pages to list their interests and have fun little images and craft their
own creative layouts.
