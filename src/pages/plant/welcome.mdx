import Footnote from '../../components/Footnote.astro'

welcome to my digital garden! it's lovely to have you here. this space is
a work in progress in terms of design and infrastructure so expect to see things
change about here and there, from time to time.

i'm looking forward to implementing my own features and starting an evolving
writing practice. this will soon be full of notes and essays and messy ideas :)

my posts are categorised using tags and statuses. the statuses represent the 
post's<Footnote>Or the *plant's* growth stage, as you'll notice the
URL calls them</Footnote> stage of growth. Here's a rundown:
* seed: for posts that are new and probably a wee bit small
* sprout: for posts that have been through a few iterations and
  are getting a little bigger
* bloom: for posts that have been revised and matured and will
  probably be quite stable

each post has the date it was first created (planted), last updated (tended),
and its current growth status. the dates are formatted as YYYY-MM-DD and are in
UTC.

thanks for coming and having a look \<3
