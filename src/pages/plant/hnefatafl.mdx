This is an implementation of the ancient nordic board game *hnefetafl*.
I implemented it in C using ncurses for a class in my first year of university.
It uses the fetlar ruleset which I sourced from [Cyningstan](http://tafl.cyningstan.com/page/88/fetlar-hnefatafl).
As one person in the comments points out, this interpretation is a bit
unbalanced but I mostly chose it because I didn't want
too much work implementing it
