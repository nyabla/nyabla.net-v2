I designed this website all by myself on the basis of finding a font I liked and
going from there. This is how I do a lot of design for fun (font first!). In this
case it was [Londrina Solid](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Londrina+Solid/about)
because it has a fun personality. The headings are set in this font. The rest of
the text is set in [Jost*](https://indestructibletype.com/Jost.html) by
indestructible type*.

My design and approach was inspired by [Maggie Appleton and her digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com/).

The design is centred around 6 columns, with most content sitting in the 3rd, 4th, and 5th.

This website is developed using [Astro](https://astro.build) because I liked the notion of
being able to use "modern" javascript front-end development while having an end-product that
is very barren of javascript (I am a javascript on websites minimalist).
