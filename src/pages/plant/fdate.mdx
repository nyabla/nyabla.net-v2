import Footnote from '../../components/Footnote.astro'

fdate is a command line utility written in rust that outputs the date according
to the [french republican calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Republican_calendar)
and the time in [decimal time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal_time).
It has formatting options closely resembling the date command.

It is available at [github.com/nyabla/fdate](https://github.com/nyabla/fdate)

My journey in implementing this was a rough one, with many false starts and a lot
of research. I started with reading up on the calendar and deciding that I wanted
to implement astronomical calculations by hand, with the help of Meeus's
*Astronomical Algorithms,*<Footnote>the 1991 edition of *Astronomical Algorithms* is available
    on the [internet archive](https://archive.org/details/astronomicalalgorithmsjeanmeeus1991/")</Footnote>which I very quickly came to regret.

With this insight I employed the help of the [astro crate](https://crates.io/crates/astro)
but I just couldn't get it to spit out the correct numbers so I got back on the
research grind. I managed to stumble across a general algorithm for converting
between julian dates to arbitrary calendars and back.<Footnote>
*Generalized Equations for Julian Day Numbers and Calendar Dates* (1985)
    by D. A. Hatcher is available online from the [astrophysics data system](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1985QJRAS..26..151H)</Footnote>
This led me on a search to find the coefficients for the french republican calendar which, surprisingly,
existed<Footnote>*Additif to 'Generalized Equations for Julian Day Numbers and Calendar Dates'*
(1986) by J. P. Parisot is also available online from the
[astrophysics data system](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1986QJRAS..27Q.506P)</Footnote>
so I was saved and could finish off my silly little project.

I did end up using good ol' Meeus for calculating the julian date and did some
simple maths to convert the time into decimal time. Also I yoinked Don Knuth's
roman numeral implementation from tex.web lol.
